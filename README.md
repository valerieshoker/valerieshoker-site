## Hi all, this is my personal website! Built from scratch, it's part digital bookshelf, part interactive living room (modeled after my own space), and part blog.
It's currently live at [valerie-site.vercel.app](https://valerie-site.vercel.app)

Home page (complete): features clickable objects, soft hover effects, etc.
Subpages (in progress): more coming soon as I build out interactive elements and projects

## Features
- Custom layout styled as a cozy living room
- Interactive hotspots with animated hover effects
- “Spin the Wheel” feature for randomized book recommendations
