hi! this is my personal website! built from scratch with love, code, and a lot of coffee. it's part digital bookshelf, part interactive living room (modeled after my own space), and part blog.

live at [valerieshoker-site.vercel.app](https://valerieshoker-site.vercel.app)

## current features
- homepage designed as a cozy room with custom layout
- interactive objects (wip): the globe spins, the cat blinks, the flowers tilt, etc.  
- “spin the wheel” feature for randomized book recommendations

## coming soon
- more objects on the shelf + floor with interactive elements 
- writing, projects, and mini tools hidden behind clickable items  
- dynamic subpages (map dashboards, small games, personal essays, etc.)



## why i built this:
i didn’t want just another portfolio site, i wanted a site that felt like me. playful, personal, exploratory. this is a space where ideas live, evolve, and occasionally spin in place.

## 💻:
- built with React + Vite, styled using Tailwind
- powered by HTML/CSS/JS, with layout crafted from PNGs, SVGs, and a lot of trial-and-error
- deployed on Vercel  
- frameworks were used, but the vibes are original lol😭
